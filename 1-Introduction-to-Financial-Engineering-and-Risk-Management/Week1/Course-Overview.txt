Financial Markets enable efficient allocation of resources across time and states of nature i.e. all conditions. 

Markets gather information, aggregate liquidity (i.e. supply and demand), and promote efficiency and fairness 

Products offered satisfy needs. Finanical products let you hedge risk, allow speculation, raise funds, and fund liabilities 

You can use discrete (single vs multi period) and continuous time market models. 

This course will focus on Discrete Time Multi-Period Models 
Less sophisticated mathematics are possible with discrete time models, but there are no closed form solutions. 
This isn't so much of a problem recently due to the cheapness of computing. 

Financial Economics - use equilibrium arguments to price financial assets and set interest rates 
Financial Engineering - Assume price of equities and interest are given, price derivatives on equities, bonds, interest rates, etc using NO-ARBITRAGE condition. 

There are three central problems of Financial Engineering 
1. Security Pricing 
- Pricing derivative securities based on existing price of primary assets
2. Portfolio Selection 
- intimately related to security pricing, surrounds choosing a trading strategy to maximize the utility of consumption and final wealth
3. Risk management 
- Understand risks inherent in the portfolio. The portfolio is already chosen, but you need to stress test it.
